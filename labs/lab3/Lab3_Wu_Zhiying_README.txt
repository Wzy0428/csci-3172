para.innerText = "This is a paragraph";
document.body.appendChild(para);

```

- <!---How---> The code in [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/met_document_createelement.asp) was implemented by using the document.createElement method to create a new row (<tr>) element in the DOM and dynamically populate it with the inventory item data (name, type, price, quantity and description). The new row is then appended to the existing table body.
- <!---Why---> [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/met_document_createelement.asp)'s Code was used because it provides a simple example of how to create and append an element in the DOM.
- <!---How---> [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/met_document_createelement.asp)'s Code was modified by creating a full table with rows that represent inventory items. Each row (<tr>) is dynamically populated with the properties of an item (name, type, price, quantity, and description) retrieved from the inventory array.

```

- <!---How---> The code in [Lab 3: Control Flow, Data Structures and Objects](https://dal.brightspace.com/d2l/le/content/361473/viewContent/4767229/View) was implemented by utilising the forEach loop to iterate through the inventory array and perform actions like displaying the list of items in a table (listItems()), filtering items based on the search query (searchItem()), and applying a discount to all items in the inventory (applyDiscount()).
- <!---Why---> [Lab 3: Control Flow, Data Structures and Objects](https://dal.brightspace.com/d2l/le/content/361473/viewContent/4767229/View)'s Code was used because it demonstrates how the forEach loop works in a simple and straightforward way. The method allows for iterating through an array and performing operations on each item without manually tracking the index
- <!---How---> [Lab 3: Control Flow, Data Structures and Objects](https://dal.brightspace.com/d2l/le/content/361473/viewContent/4767229/View)'s Code was modified to iterate over the inventory array and execute specific operations for each item, such as displaying item details, adding new items, removing items, or applying a discount. For example, after applying a discount, the inventory table is re-rendered with updated prices.

```

- <!---How---> The code in [mdn web docs][mdn web docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/findIndex) was implemented by using the findIndex() method to locate the index of an element within an array based on a specified condition
- <!---Why---> [mdn web docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/findIndex)'s Code was used because this method helps in finding a specific item (using the item name) so that the removal of an item can be performed in the array. 
- <!---How---> [mdn web docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/findIndex)'s Code was modified by adjusting the condition to search for an inventory item based on its name rather than just checking numbers.

## Artificial Intelligence Tools Used

* [chatgpt](https://chatgpt.com/) - The AI Tool used

### Prompt Used on *chatgpt*

```
how to confirm if a item is removed in Js, a pop up message to double check?

```

The code prompt above was used [chatgpt](https://chatgpt.com/) to generate the code shown below: 

```
function removeItem(itemId) {
    // Ask the user for confirmation
    const isConfirmed = confirm("Are you sure you want to remove this item?");

    // If the user confirms, proceed with removing the item
    if (isConfirmed) {
        // Your code to remove the item, e.g., removing from an array or DOM
        console.log(`Item ${itemId} removed.`);
        
        // Assuming you're removing from an array:
        let itemList = ["item1", "item2", "item3"];
        itemList = itemList.filter(item => item !== itemId);
        console.log(itemList);  // Updated list
    } else {
        console.log("Item removal cancelled.");
    }
}

// Example usage:
removeItem("item2");

```

#### File Name
script.js

*Lines ## - ##*
Line 95-101

```
if (confirmRemoval) {
            inventory.splice(itemIndex, 1);
            //Show an alert message
            alert(`${name} has been removed from the inventory.`);
            //Update the display
            listItems();
        }
```

- <!---How---> The code in [chatgpt](https://chatgpt.com/) was implemented by using the confirm() method in JavaScript prompts the user with a confirmation dialog (with "OK" and "Cancel" buttons) before proceeding with the removal of an item
- <!---Why---> [chatgpt](https://chatgpt.com/)'s Code was used because it effectively handles the task of asking the user for confirmation before proceeding with an action. The confirmation pop-up helps prevent accidental deletions or unwanted actions.
- <!---How---> [chatgpt](https://chatgpt.com/)'s Code was modified by adjusting to remove an item from the inventory array, updating the list of items displayed on the page after removal, and showing an alert message with the name of the item is shown to confirm the deletion.
