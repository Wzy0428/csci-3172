*Lines ## - ##*
Line 8, 11

Copy and paste your code on lines mentioned:

```
input.style.backgroundColor = 'pink';
input.style.backgroundColor = '';

```

The code above was created by adapting the code in [NAME](link) as shown below: 
w3schools
https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/prop_style_backgroundcolor.asp

Copy and paste the snippet of code you are referencing:

```
object.style.backgroundColor

```

- <!---How---> The code in [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/prop_style_backgroundcolor.asp) was implemented by adding event listeners on the form input elements for the focus and blur events. When the focus event occurs, the background colour of the input field is changed, and when the blur event happens, the background colour is reset.
- <!---Why---> [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/prop_style_backgroundcolor.asp)
(https://dal.brightspace.com/d2l/le/content/361473/Home)'s Code was used because I can interact with DOM elements by modifying its colour property directly.
- <!---How---> [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/prop_style_backgroundcolor.asp)'s Code was modified by adapting it to listen for focus and blur events on the form input fields (firstName, lastName, email). On focus, I changed the background colour to 'pink' and on blur, I reset the background colour to its default state.

The rest code in the file: index.html, styles.css and script.js are provided by Gabriella Mosquera in the Lecture and Activity 9.
